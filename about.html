                    <p>I would like the website to branch out into two more directions; sporting equipment and exercise videos. Eventually, the website will allow for college students to purchase sporting equipment. This feature will entail showing customers different equipment based upon their needs. For instance, if a college student simply wants to get fit. They would click on the Healthy/Active section of the website and pick equipment from there. A different college student may want equipment for skiing, so they would go to that corresponding section.   </p>
                </div>
                <p>  Another direction that I would like to see the website take is posting exercise videos for college students. We all know that between studying and going to class, there's practically no time for students to hit the gym. So why not bring the gym to their room. The website will showcase a gym instructor in an average college dorm room doing a variety of exercises. These exercises will be designed for little to no equipment being needed, be quick yet effective, and lastly not require much space. </p>
